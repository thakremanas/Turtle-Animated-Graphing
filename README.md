# Turtle-Animated-Graphing

In this Python Script, I attempt to use a graphing "turtle" to plot some basic bar charts using the sample data from the files stored in the data folder of this repository. You can use other data of your interest to do the same by tweaking my code wherever needed.

The functions written in the script guide the turtle movements to draw all the key elements of this chart.

## Enjoy graphing :)
